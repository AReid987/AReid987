# **Hey, üëãüèæ I'm Antonio. ü§©**

## About Me

I like problems. I believe the arena for learning is found inside a challenge, an obstacle, even a blunder. 

I like people. Knowledge can be gained from everyday life. I find that people are an endless source of things I don't know. 

I'm very compelled to solve people's problems using technology. It has to be my favorite game of all time. 

I have historically called myself a Software Developor, however these days I think a lot more about the User and their Problems. The rest I think of moreso as potential tools I can leverage to solve with. 

## Currently ü§î

Agents, naturally. Finding the right point in the execution stack to plant a non determistic entity with reasoning abilities is a fascinating way to compose logic. Orchestrating DevSecOps, summoning the outsized capabilities of an ever expanding legion of super intelligence is like living in my very own Sci-Fi Film. 

What has been keeping me most joyfully occupied has bee redefining work. Every aspect - processes, perspectives, mental models, lexicon.... This may be a Renaissance.

Agents... This one is deep. I gravitate toward open source repositories. I enjoy find a very new release and getting to refactor things for a set of capabilites or to fix bugs. 
The most frequent use case I have had for agents has been development activities, (including pairing with agents to build agents). 

Some FOSS implementations that standout:

Aider
OpenHands
Goose
Bolt.diy
GPTme
Open Interpreter
GPT Pilot
